This is a question-generating application where the user writes a piece of scientific text and the model outputs questions based on that text.
At the moment we have fine-tuned the FLAN-T5-Base and BART-Large models on the r/AskScience dataset and also include the zero-shot output from FLAN-T5-XXL and GPT-3.5.
